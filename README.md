## Conclusion
- Product sales trend in 2021 decreased compared to 2020
- The product category that customers are most interested in is eBooks
- The product category that provides the highest sales for the company is Robots, while eBooks is one of the product categories that generates the lowest sales even though it sells the most.



## Recommendation
PT Sejahtera Bersama should consider:
- Increase the price of eBooks so that their sales increases, or 
- Reduce the price of Robots so that customers are interested in buying Robot products
- Set feasible sales targets to drive company growth

Of course these are done with prior market research and further analysis. 
Other than price changes, company must carry out even more promotion of Robot or other products which sales are less than other products
